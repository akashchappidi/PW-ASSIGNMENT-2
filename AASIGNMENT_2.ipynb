        "Q-1 What are data structures, and why are they important ?\n",
        "\n",
        "->Data structures are organized ways to store and manage data efficiently. They are crucial in Python as they determine how data is accessed, manipulated, and used in algorithms. Common examples include lists, dictionaries, sets, and trees, each with its own strengths for different tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q-2 Explain the difference between mutable and immutable data  types with examples\n",
        "\n",
        "-->Mutable Data Types:\n",
        "\n",
        "Values can be changed after creation.\n",
        "Examples: Lists, dictionaries, sets.\n",
        "\n",
        "Immutable Data Types:\n",
        "\n",
        "Values cannot be changed after creation.\n",
        "Examples: Integers, floats, strings, tuples.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q-3) What are the main differences between lists and tuples in PythON?\n",
        "-->Mutability:\n",
        "\n",
        "Lists: Mutable, meaning their elements can be changed, added, or removed after creation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Tuples: Immutable, meaning their elements cannot be changed once created.\n",
        "Syntax:\n",
        "\n",
        "Lists: Enclosed in square brackets [].\n",
        "Tuples: Enclosed in parentheses ().\n",
        "\n",
        "Q-4) Describe how dictionaries store data.\n",
        "\n",
        "--> Dictionaries in Python store data in key-value pairs. This means that each piece of data is associated with a unique identifier called a key. To access a specific value, you use its corresponding key\n",
        "\n",
        "Q-5)  Why might you use a set instead of a list in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "-->Sets guarantee uniqueness of elements, eliminating the need for duplicate removal.\n",
        "Membership checks in sets are significantly faster than in lists due to their underlying hash-based implementation.\n",
        "Sets efficiently support mathematical set operations like union, intersection, and difference, making them well-suited for tasks involving set logic.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q-6) What is a string in Python, and how is it different from a list\n",
        "\n",
        "-->Strings are immutable sequences of characters, representing text data.\n",
        "Lists are mutable collections of arbitrary objects, including strings, numbers, and other data types.\n",
        "Key difference: Strings cannot be modified after creation, while lists allow for dynamic changes like adding, removing, or modifying elements.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q-7) How do tuples ensure data integrity in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "-->tuples are immutable, meaning their contents cannot be changed after creation.\n",
        "This immutability prevents accidental modifications, ensuring data consistency and reliability, especially when dealing with sensitive or critical information.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q-8) What is a hash table, and how does it relate to dictionaries in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "-->A hash table is a data structure that uses a hash function to map keys to specific locations within an array, enabling fast data access. Python dictionaries are implemented using hash tables, allowing for efficient storage and retrieval of key-value pairs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q-9) Can lists contain different data types in Python\n",
        "-->Yes, lists in Python are incredibly versatile. They can hold elements of different data types within the same list. This allows for flexible data representation and manipulation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q-10) Explain why strings are immutable in Python\n",
        "--> Efficiency: Immutability allows for string interning, where common strings are stored only once in memory, saving space and improving performance.\n",
        "Security: Immutability helps prevent accidental or malicious modifications to string data, enhancing the security of applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q-11) What advantages do dictionaries offer over lists for certain tasks ?\n",
        "-->Fast lookups: You need to quickly access data based on unique identifiers (keys)\n",
        "Data organization: You want to organize data into key-value pairs, providing a more structured and meaningful way to represent relationships.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q-12) Describe a scenario where using a tuple would be preferable\n",
        "\n",
        "-->You would prefer a tuple over a list when you need to ensure that a collection of data remains constant and cannot be accidentally modified, such as when storing configuration settings or representing immutable coordinates.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q-13) How do sets handle duplicate values in Python\n",
        "--> Python, sets automatically remove duplicate values, ensuring that each element within the set is unique.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q-14)  How does the “in” keyword work differently for lists and dictionaries\n",
        "--> Lists: The in keyword checks if a value exists within the sequence of elements in the list.\n",
        "Dictionaries: The in keyword checks if a given key exists within the dictionary.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q-15)Can you modify the elements of a tuple? Explain why or why not\n",
        "-->No, you cannot modify the elements of a tuple. Tuples are immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed after they are created. This ensures data integrity and prevents accidental 1  alterations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q-16)What is a nested dictionary, and give an example of its use case\n",
        "\n",
        "-->A nested dictionary is a dictionary where the values are themselves dictionaries, enabling the representation of hierarchical data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q-17) Describe the time complexity of accessing elements in a dictionary\n",
        "-->The time complexity of accessing elements in a dictionary is O(1), meaning it typically takes constant time, regardless of the dictionary's size.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q-18) In what situations are lists preferred over dictionaries\n",
        "-->Ordered sequences: When maintaining the order of elements is crucial, lists are preferred.\n",
        "Flexible modifications: When frequent additions, removals, and modifications are needed, lists provide more flexibility than dictionaries.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q-19) Why are dictionaries considered unordered, and how does that affect data retrieval\n",
        "-->Dictionaries in Python are considered unordered because they don't maintain a specific sequence of their key-value pairs. While they preserve insertion order in recent Python versions, it's not guaranteed. This doesn't affect key-based lookups, but it can impact operations that rely on the order of items, such as iteration.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q-20) Explain the difference between a list and a dictionary in terms of data retrieval.\n",
        "\n",
        "-->Lists: Retrieve elements based on their position (index), which can be less efficient for large lists.\n",
        "Dictionaries: Retrieve values based on their unique keys, providing extremely fast lookups in constant time (O(1)\n",
